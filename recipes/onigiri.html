    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups cooked white Japanese short grain rice (about 1 1/4 cups dry)</li>
        <li>2 sheets of toasted nori, cut into 2 inch wide strips</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Water (for wetting hands)</li>
        <li>Furikake</li>
        <li>Umeboshi</li>
        <li>Mentaiko</li>
        <li>Canned tuna with soy sauce</li>
        <li>Bonito flakes with soy sauce</li>
        <li>Tonkatsu</li>
        <li>Spam</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and cook your rice. Gently fluff rice and divide it into 1 cup portions. If you wish to add furikake, mix it into your rice at this point. 
            Let cool slightly until it can be handled comfortably with your bare hands before forming the rice into onigiri.</li><br>
        <li>Dampen your clean hands with water, and then sprinkle them with salt. Scoop up one portion of the rice into one hand. 
            Gently make an indentation in the rice using your free hand. Place 1-2 tsp of filling into the indentation.
            Wrap the rice around the filling, forming it into a ball shape.</li><br>
        <li>From here, you can shape your onigiri into pretty much any shape you wish. To make it into the iconic triangle shape, 
            keep your fingers straight and create the triangle's corners at the place where your palms and fingers meet. 
            turn the rice over and over in your hands to form the triangle shape until you're satisfied.<br>
            If you're not comfortable with using your hands to shape the rice ball, you can also place the rice (with the filling inside) onto a piece of plastic wrap. 
            Use the plastic wrap to envelop the rice ball, and then gently mould it into your preferred shape.</li><br>
        <li>Wrap with a strip or two of nori and serve!</li>
